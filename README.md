## Description

This project focuses on implementing Java's concurrency concepts to enhance application performance and scalability.
Concurrency is essential for modern software development, especially in applications where multiple tasks must be executed simultaneously to achieve optimal performance. 
This project explores various concurrency mechanisms the Java platform provides, such as threads, executors, synchronization, and concurrent data structures.

## Features [DRAFT]
- Implementation examples of all parts of the platform and virtual threads. 
- Implementation of multi-threading using the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.
- Utilization of thread pools and executors for managing concurrent tasks efficiently.
- Synchronization techniques to ensure thread safety using `synchronized` blocks and methods.
- Atomic variables and locks for fine-grained control over shared resources.
- Concurrent collections for high-performance data sharing among threads.
- Handling concurrent problems such as deadlock, livelock, and race conditions.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or above installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java programming language and object-oriented concepts.
